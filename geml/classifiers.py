        representation (Representation): The individual representation used by the GP program. The default is TreeBasedRepresentation.

        seed (int): The seed for the RandomSource (default = 123).
        population_size (int): The population size (default = 200). Apart from the first generation, each generation the population is made up of the elites, novelties, and transformed individuals from the previous generation. Note that population_size > (elitism + novelty + 1) must hold.
        elitism (int): Number of elites, i.e. the number of best individuals that are preserved every generation (default = 5).

        number_of_generations (int): Number of generations (default = 100).
        max_depth (int): The maximum depth a tree can have (default = 15).
        favor_less_complex_trees (bool): If set to True, this gives a tiny penalty to deeper trees to favor simpler trees (default = False).
        hill_climbing (bool): Allows the user to change the standard mutation operations to the hill-climbing mutation operation, in which an individual is mutated to 5 different new individuals, after which the best is chosen to survive (default = False).

        mutation_probability (float): probability that an individual is mutated (default = 0.01).
        crossover_probability (float): probability that an individual is chosen for cross-over (default = 0.9).
