A hybrid between strongly-typed (STGP) and grammar-guided genetic programming (GGGP).

About GeneticEngine
-------------------

GeneticEngine is a Genetic Programming framework for single- and multi-objective optimization. GeneticEngine allows the user to provide domain knowledge about the shape of the solution (using type annotations) and by defining the fitness function.


Documentation
-------------

* [Documentation](https://geneticengine.readthedocs.io/)
* [Examples](examples/)

```python
class MyExpr(ABC):
	"MyExpr is a non-terminal/abstract class."
	def eval(self):
		...

@dataclass
class Plus(MyExpr):
	"E -> E + E"
	left: MyExpr
	right: MyExpr

	def eval(self):
		return self.left.eval() + self.right.eval()

@dataclass
class Literal(MyExpr):
	"E -> <int>"
	value: int

	def eval(self):
		return self.value
```

In this small example, we are defining the language that supports the plus operator and integer literals. GeneticEngine will be able to automatically generate all possible expressions, such as `Plus(left=Plus(left=Literal(12), right=Literal(12)), right=Literal(15))`, and guide the search towards your goal (e.g., `lambda x: abs(x-2022)`). For this very simple toy problem, it will find an expression that computes 2022, ideally as small as possible. And this is a very uninteresting example. But if you introduce variables into the mix, you have a very powerful symbolic regression toolkit for arbitrarily complex expressions.
